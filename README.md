- 👋 Hi, I’m @aran-nascimento and I am a Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing Student.
- 👀 I’m interested in many different things, anything you show me will make me curious. I like food (hmmm, um cuscuz) and books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about math, physics and automation of ETL processes, a little bit of SQL, Python/PySpark and AWS Services. 
- 📫 Nice to meet you!
